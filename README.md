# EventHive

Platform for posting/browsing events written using code-first approach in C# as web API with frontend in pure JS (yes, this was painful) and bootstrap. 
MySql is used as DBMS.
The whole project is dockerized. Users can create events with categories (that can also be easily added), different ticket types (price, kind of experience), 
and promo codes, search for events they could like, purchasing tickets etc. There even is a Privacy page with persuasive message describing our commitment.
